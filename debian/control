Description: portable DHCPv6 server
 This is a DHCPv6 server. It supports both stateful (i.e. IPv6 address 
 granting) as well as stateless (i.e. options granting) autoconfiguration 
 modes of DHCPv6 protocol. Relays are also supported. Install Dibbler 
 server if you'd like to have IPv6 hosts automatically configured in 
 your network.

Description: portable DHCPv6 client
 This is a DHCPv6 client. It supports both statefull (i.e. IPv6 address
 granting) as well as stateless (i.e. option granting) autoconfiguration
 modes of the DHCPv6 protocol. Besides basic capabilities, it supports
 various DHCPv6 extensions, e.g. option renewal. Install Dibber client if
 you want to obtain IPv6 addresses and options from DHCPv6 server.

Description: portable DHCPv6 relay
