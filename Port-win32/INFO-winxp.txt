 Usage:
--------

1. Running
dibbler-server.exe ACTION -d dirname -i ipv6path
e.g.: dibbler-server.exe run -d "c:\dibbler\\" -i "c:\windows\system32\ipv6.exe"
Please note double backslashes at the end of paths.
	
where
	ACTION = status|start|stop|install|uninstall|run
	status    - show status and exit
	start     - start installed service
	stop      - stop installed service
	install   - install service
	uninstall - uninstall service
	run       - run interactively

2. Config file sanity check
Do not use interface names. Use interface number instead.

 Compilation
-------------

1. flex/bison++ under win32
To generate ClntParser.cpp and ClntLexer.cpp files, you can use
parser.bat. After generation, in file ClntLexer.cpp replace:
class istream;
with:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

2. flex binary included in cvs is slightly modified. It generates
#include "FlexLexer.h" instead of #include <FlexLexer.h>. You should
add .\ to include path if you have problem with missing FlexLexer.h.
Also note that FlexLexer.h is modified (std:: added in several places,
<fstream.h> is replaced with <fstream> etc.
