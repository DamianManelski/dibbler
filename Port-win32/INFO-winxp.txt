1. Running

dibbler-server.exe ACTION -d dirname 
e.g.: dibbler-client-winxp.exe install -d "c:\devel\dibbler\port-winxp"

Please note that double backslashes at the end of path are no longer needed.
	
where
	ACTION = status|start|stop|install|uninstall|run
	status    - show status and exit
	start     - start installed service
	stop      - stop installed service
	install   - install service
	uninstall - uninstall service
	run       - run interactively

2. Config file sanity check has some bugs
Do not use interface names. Use interface number instead.

3. If you get 10004 error, please add following lines to your
   client.conf to avoid virtual interfaces configuration:
iface 1 no-config
iface 2 no-config
iface 3 no-config

 Compilation
-------------

1. flex/bison++ under win32
To generate ClntParser.cpp and ClntLexer.cpp files, you can use
parser.bat. After generation, in file ClntLexer.cpp replace:
class istream;
with:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

2. flex binary included in cvs is slightly modified. It generates
#include "FlexLexer.h" instead of #include <FlexLexer.h>. You should
add .\ to include path if you have problem with missing FlexLexer.h.
Also note that FlexLexer.h is modified (std:: added in several places,
<fstream.h> is replaced with <fstream> etc.
