 Compilation
-------------

1. flex/bison++ under win32
To generate ClntParser.cpp and ClntLexer.cpp files, you can use
parser.bat. After generation, in file ClntLexer.cpp replace:
class istream;
with:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

2. flex binary included in cvs is slightly modified. It generates
#include "FlexLexer.h" instead of #include <FlexLexer.h>. You should
add .\ to include path if you have problem with missing FlexLexer.h.
Also note that FlexLexer.h is modified (std:: added in several places,
<fstream.h> is replaced with <fstream> etc.
