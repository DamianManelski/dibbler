  Internal TODO
 ---------------

- addrmgr dump has problems with duid dump
- UPGRADE: WORKDIR should be a global variable. So reasonable default could be applied.
  It can also be overwritten from command line
- BUG: ClntTransMgr:82 - socket is opened on specific LL addr, but Linux does not read LL addrs
- release first public version, display info about version and compilation time
- fill stucture desrcibing iface with link local addresses available on this iface
- merge Tentative and State in IAa
- IA_TA option support
- AddrMgr: db load from file
- bug: SrvMsgReply:331 - always replies with NoBinding. 
- finish CONFIRM (db load required)
- implement useMulticast
- implement Server Unicast
- How to update pref/valid?
- Srv: DECLINE should have addrs with valid=preferred=0 values
- ClntCfgIface.cpp:107: what are "additonal DNS servers"?
- ClntCfgIface.cpp:157: what are those options?
- check server's behavior: there isn't any addrs left, and srv receives SOLICIT.
  Does PREFERENCE have normal value (e.g. not faulty 255, check tex/test09/10th packet)

  BUGS
 ------
- When client receives NO-ADDR AVAILABLE, it simultaneusly:
  - starts SOLICIT transaction
  - sends REQUEST to next server on backup list.
- test11: reply contains empty IA with 2 STATUS CODE options:
  - unspecfail (1) + description "no such IA"
  - ok (!!!)
