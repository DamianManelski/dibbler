  Internal/code TODO
 --------------------
- Remove ClntCfgGroup class
- Statistics: TransMgr->dump() should be implemented.
- Change Srv/ClntOptServer/ClientIdentifier to use TOptGeneric class.
- IfaceMgr.cpp:232 (remove #ifndef WIN32)

- Clnt requests for Address and options (receives both and lifetime option). It should send renew only if T1<lifetime
  and renew and inf-request if T1>lifetime.

- 20. RFC3315: If the relay agent has not been explicitly configured,
  it MUST use the All_DHCP_Servers multicast address as the default.

- setting up a domain: echo homenetwork > /etc/dnsdomainname
- Flex (gentoo: emerge /usr/portage/sys-devel/flex/flex-2.5.31-r1.ebuild)

- check server's behavior: there isn't any addrs left, and srv receives SOLICIT.
  Does PREFERENCE have normal value (e.g. not faulty 255, check
   tex/test09/10th packet)


  Rewrite
 ---------
1. client's answers are generated by answer(...) method, whereas server's answer's 
   are generated in the relayMsg method by differents constructors of the same message.
   Shouldn't it be better to make it homogeneous ? I don't have any preference :)
2. ClntIfaceMgr: remove ugly sleep(3) instruction.

  BUGS
 ------
 See http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/

- When client receives NO-ADDR AVAILABLE, it simultaneusly:
  - starts SOLICIT transaction
  - sends REQUEST to next server on backup list.
- test11: reply contains empty IA with 2 STATUS CODE options:
  - unspecfail (1) + description "no such IA"
  - ok (!!!)


  INFO
 ------
- kernel sources: 
   addrconf.c:  inet6_rtm_newaddr() :1579
   ipv6_add_addr
   ndisc.c ndisc_router_discovery
