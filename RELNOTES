  Dibbler 0.5.0 alpha snapshot release notes [2006-08-22]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is NOT a release. It is a merely a snapshot of the current work, which contains
 preview of the features, which will be available in the final 0.5.0 release.

 New features are:
 - DNS Updates support, also know as FQDN
 - Temporary addresses support
 - Server cache 

 Since this is only a snapshot, it is not complete and does not have all of the
 features fully functional. Also the documentation is not complete.

 If you find bugs, please report it on http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/
 or send bug report directly to the author. Appropriate links are on 
 project website: http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/
