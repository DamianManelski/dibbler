  Dibbler 0.4.0-RC1 release notes [2005-02-03]
 ------------------------------------------

 This version is the first one with relay support. Server supports relays. 
 Stand alone relay is also available. Although I have spent many hours 
 testing this and everything worked fine, I cannot guarantee that this will 
 work for you. 

 Duplicate Address Detection does not work under Windows XP/2003.
