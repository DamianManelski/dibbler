  Dibbler 0.6.0 release notes [2007-05-05]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is a 0.6.0 release. 

 Changes since 0.5.0 are rather huge: Full list is described in CHANGELOG.

 Main new features in 0.6.0 (compared to 0.5.0):
 - Support for anonymous INF-REQUEST messages
 - Support for inactive (e.g. not associated wifi) interfaces
 - Interoperability improved (as a result of 2 day interop test session)
 - Client is now able to properly choose between several servers available
 - Support for cascade relays is now working properly
 - Prefix delegation support
 - Vendor specific information support
 - Elapsed option fixes and improvements
 - DUID type is now configurable
 - Lots of bug fixes and smaller improvements
 - Documentation update (now 60+ pages long, with pictures)

 That is also first release with experimental feature called Address
 Parameters. It allows clients to configure IPv6 addresses with appropriate
 prefixes, so routing is configured properly. Ssee Address Parameters in 
 Dibbler User's Guide for details.
