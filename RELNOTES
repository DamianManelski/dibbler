  Dibbler 0.4.0 release notes [2005-03-15]
 ------------------------------------------

 This version is the first stable release with relay support.
 Relaying is supported in two ways: Server supports relays. Stand alone relay
 is also available. Although I have spent many hours testing it and 
 everything worked fine, I cannot guarantee that this will work for you. 

 Duplicate Address Detection does not work under Windows XP/2003. 

 Special thanks to Christian Carlowitz for his excellent bug report.
