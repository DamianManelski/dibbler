  Dibbler 0.7.1 release notes [2008-06-18]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is a final 0.7.1 release. 

 Biggest improvement since 0.6.1 is support for lease query, authentication
 and countless bug fixes. Technically speaking, lease query was available
 in the 0.7.0, which was "quasi-released", as a source code only and 
 unannounced. To avoid confusion, I decided to skip 0.7.0 rerelease and
 here is the 0.7.1.

 Changes:
  - Leasequery support (new entity: requestor added)
  - Authentication support
  - Experimental support for Microsoft Vista
  - Server now supports relays with unknown interface-ids better
  - Numerous fixes after 2nd(Vancouver) and 3rd(Philadelphia) bakeoff meetings

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.
