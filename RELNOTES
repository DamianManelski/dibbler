  Dibbler 0.3.0-RC2 release notes
 ---------------------------------
  
 This version incorporates two simple, yet critical bugfixes: server crash when
 receiving IA option without IAADDR suboption and improper socket initialization
 in Linux.

 Main goal of this release is to improve stateless configuration support.
 Lots of new options were added and support for already present was improved.
 
 Socket binding has changed. REUSE_ADDR is used no more. There is still unresolved
 issue with running server and client on the same Linux host. It probably will
 be removed in the full 0.3.0 release.
