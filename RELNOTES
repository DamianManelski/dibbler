  Dibbler 0.4.1 release notes [2005-06-07]
 ------------------------------------------

 This is a bug fix release. It contains heavy improvements in relay
 support. Previous Windows version in some rare cases died quietly
 during interface detection. That issue is fixed now. Command line
 usage for Windows systems is also simplified.
