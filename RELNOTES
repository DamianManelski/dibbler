  Dibbler 0.8.0RC1 release notes [2010-09-17]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is first release candidate (RC1) for 0.8.0 Dibbler release.

 Dibbler (and myself) is now recovering after long maintenance mode.
 There are couple of new features added. Client loads its database
 and if there are still valid leases, it sends CONFIRM instead of
 SOLICIT. In Linux systems, client can also detect link switches, 
 so once your Linux client moves to a different link, it will send
 CONFIRM, too. Server reloads its database after restart, so you can
 finally restaring server, without worrying about lost leases. DUID
 can now be specified using 00:12:45:ab format (similar to MAC addresses).
 Support for Windows 7 and Mac OS is now added (both considered experimental).
 Both server and client support custom options, so if dibbler does
 not support your favourite option, here's your chance. 

 Bunch of experimental features are also added: DS-Lite tunnel
 configuration and remote autoconfiguration.
 
 There's also number of under the hood changes that hopefully
 will be invisible to end users. If something that worked previously
 now crashes miserably, let me know.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.
