  Dibbler 0.4.0 release notes [NOT RELEASED YET]
 ------------------------------------------

 This version is the first one with relay support. Althougt I have spent many hours
 testing this and everything worked fine, I cannot guarantee that this will work
 for you. 

 Duplicate Address Detection does not work under Windows XP/2003. 





  


 This version fixes bug with link local addresses on certain systems. 
 DEB package for Debian systems is provided. Except that, it is almost 
 identhical to 0.3.0, so here is 0.3.0 info:
  
 This [0.3.0] version incorporates lots of fixes for bugs reported by various 
 users. It is considered stable. All changes are mentioned in the
 CHANGELOG file. 

 This [0.3.0] version is a first one which is also available as RPM package 
 for Linux and binary installer for Windows. Those installation methods
 are relatively new and untested, so the usual tar.gz version is also
 available.
  
 If you find bugs, please report it on http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/
 or send bug report directly to the author. Appropriate links are on 
 project website: http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/

 This release is dedicated to memory of my grandfather Brunon 
 Czurlowski, who passed out recently.
