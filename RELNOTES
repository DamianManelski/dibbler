  Dibbler 0.7.0 release notes [2008-02-23]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is a final 0.7.0 release. 

 Biggest improvement since 0.6.1 is support for lease query.
 As usual, numerous bugs were fixed and documentation has been updated
 once again.

 Changes:
  - Leasequery support (new entity: requestor added)
  - Numerous fixes after Vancover 2nd bakeoff meeting
  - CLI: REQUEST is sent to multicast when unicast option is supported
    (because client does not have address with sufficient scope)
  - Fix in all string options (like domain name or nis domain)
  - Fix in DNS Update (memory corruption fixed)
  - Documentation updated.
