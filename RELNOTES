  Dibbler 0.4.0-RC2 release notes [2005-03-08]
 ------------------------------------------

 This version is the second release candidate for 0.4.0 - a first version with 
 relay support. Server supports relays. Stand alone relay is also available. 
 Although I have spent many hours testing this and everything worked fine, I 
 cannot guarantee that this will work for you. 

 Duplicate Address Detection does not work under Windows XP/2003. 

 Special thanks to Bernie Volz for reporting those two bugs.
