  GUIDELINES
 ------------
 1. SPtr can be created only:
    - from other SPtr  (automatic conversion)
    - using new() memory allocator ( SPtr<foo> = new foo(); )
 2. Don't use unsigned char *, use char * instead.
 3. Object/Function/Variables prefixes: 
    - Clnt Srv  (server/client)
    - Cfg Iface Addr Trans (managers)
    - Lst (list)
 4. Lists are operated by methods: i.e. for Addr list, ther should be
    methods addAddr(), firstAddr(), getAddr() etc.
 5. Lists which will not be modified are parsed as pointers.
 5. Before running doDuties() on OptIA_NA, one should run setThats() and setSrvDUID().
 6. (Ptr*) is used ONLY while casting one SPtr on another SPtr.
 7. Port-specific files MUST be places in dir named port-PORTNAME
