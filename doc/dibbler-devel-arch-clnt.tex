\section{Common Architecture}

There are 4 managers:
\begin{itemize}
\item TIfaceMgr -- Interface Manager. It represents all network interfaces present in the
  system. They're represented by TIfaceIface objects and stored in
  IfaceLst. Each interface has list of open sockets, represented with
  TIfaceSocket objects. There are also a number of auxiliary functions
  for getting proper interface. 
\item TAddrMgr -- Address Manager. It is an address database, which
  stores all informations about clients, IAs and associated addresses.
\item TCfgMgr -- Config Manager. It is being used to read
  configuration information from config file and provide those
  informations while runtime.
\item TTransMgr -- Transmission Manager, sometimes called Transaction
  Manager. It is responsible for network interaction and logic. It
  sends various messages when such need arise, matches received
  responses with sent messages, retransmits etc. It contains list of
  messages currently being used.
\end{itemize}

\section{Client Architecture}

Client is represented by a DHCPClient object. It contains 4 large
managers, each with its own functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item IfaceMgr
\item AddrMgr
\item CfgMgr
\item TransMgr

\end{itemize}
