\section{Miscellanous tips}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ethereal, a widely used network sniffer/analyzer has a bug with
  parsing DHCPv6 message: SIP options are always reported as
  malformed. Also NIS/NIS+ options have improper values (not
  comformant to RFC3898). To work around that problem, download
  packet-dhcpv6.c from Dibbler homepage and recompile Ethereal.
\item If you are reading this Developer's Guide, then Hey! You're
  probably a developer! If you found any bugs (or think you found
  one), go to the
  \href{http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla}{http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla}
   and report it. If you report was a mistake -- oh well, you just
  lost 5 minutes. But if it was really a bug, you have just improved
  next Dibbler version.
\item If you have any questions about Dibbler or DHCPv6, feel free to
  mail me.
