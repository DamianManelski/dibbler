\section{Basic informations}

In this section various common aspects of the Dibbler internal
workings are decribed.

\subsection{Option values and filenames}

Dibbler uses several options which are specified in drafts rather than
RFC documents. IANA organisation does not assign proper, well known
number to options that are in the draft phase. Some values must be
choosen arbitrarily. This must be kept in mind, expecially when there
is an interoperability considered. All values used are specified in the
\verb+misc/DHCPConst.h+ file. 

In default build, Dibbler stores all information in the
\verb+/var/lib/dibbler+ directory (Linux) or in the working directory
(Windows). There are multiple files stored in those
directories. However, sometime there is a need to build Dibbler which uses
different directory or filename. To do so, simply edit
\verb+misc/Portable.h+ file.

\subsection{Memory Manegement using SmartPtr}
To effectively fight memory leaks, clever mechanism was introduced.
