\section{History}
 Dibbler project was started as master thesis by Tomasz Mrugalski and
Marek Senderski of  Computer Science faculty on Gdansk University of
Technology. Both authors graduated in september 2003 and soon after
started their jobs. 

Sadly, Marek does not have free time to develop Dibbler, so his
involvment is very limited at this time. However, that does not mean,
that this project is abadoned. It is being actively developed by
Tomek. Keep in mind that Tomek works at full time and does
Ph.D. studies, so his free time is also greatly limited.

\section{Contact}
There is an website located at \url{http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6}. If
you belive you have found a bug, please put it in Bugzilla -- it is a
bug tracking system located at \url{http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla}. If
you are not familiar with that kind of system, don't worry. After
simple registration, you will be asked for system and Dibbler version
you are using and so on. Without feedback from users, author will not
be aware of many bugs and so will not be able to fix them. That's why
users feedback is very important. You can also send bug report
directly using e-mail. Be sure to be as detailed as possible. Please
include both server and client log files with maximum verbose level
set. 

If you have used Dibbler and it worked ok, this documentation answered
all you question and everything is in order (hmmm, wake up, it must be
a dream, it isn't reality:), also send a short note to author. He can
be contated at thomson(at)klub(dot)com(dot)pl (replace (at) with @ and
dot with .). Be sure to include information which country do you live
in. It's just author's curiosity to know where Dibbler is used.

\section{Thanks and greetings}

I would like to send my thanks and greetings to numerous persons.
Without them, Dibbler would not be where is it today.
\begin{description}
\item[Marek Senderski] -- He's author of almost half of the Dibbler
  code. Without his efforts, Dibbler would be simple, long forgotten
  by now master thesis without him.
\item[Jacek Swiatowiak] -- He's my master thesis consultant. He guided 
  Marek and me to take first steps with DHCPv6 implementation.
\item[Ania Szulc] -- Discworld fan and a great girl, too. She's the one
  who helped me to decide how to name this yet-untitled DHCPv6 implementation.
\item[Christian Strauf] -- Without his queries and questions, Dibbler
  would be abadoned half a year or so ago.
\item[Bartek Gajda] -- His interest convinced me that Dibbler is worth
  the effort to develop it further.
\item[Artur Binczewski and Maciej Patelczyk] -- They both ensured that
  Dibbler is (and always will be) GNU GPL software. Open source
  community is greateful.
\item[Josep Sole] -- His mails (directly and indirectly) resulted in
  various fixes and speeded up 0.2.0 release.
