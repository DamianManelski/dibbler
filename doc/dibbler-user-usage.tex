\section{Installation and usage}
Client, server and relay are installed in the same way. Installation
method is different in Windows and Linux systems, so they're described
separately. To simplify installation, it assumes that binary versions
are used\footnote{Compilation is not required, binary version can be
  used safely. Compilation should be performed by
  advanced users only, see \emph{Compilation} section for details.}.

\subsection{Linux installation}
Starting with 0.4.1, there will are 3 different packages: client,
server and relay. For some architectures there will be also
documentation package provided. During writing this documentation,
Dibbler is already present in:
\begin{itemize}
\item the PLD Linux Distribution 2.0 (in the test section)
\item Gentoo GNU/Linux
\end{itemize}
There are efforts under way to include Dibbler in Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

Obtain (e.g. download from \url{http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/}) an
archive, which suits your needs. Currently there are provided RPM packages
(which can be used in RedHat, Fedora Core, Mandrake or PLD
distribution), DEB packages (suitable for Debian or Knoppix) and
ebuild (for Gentoo users). To install rpm package, run $rpm -i
archive.rpm$ command. For example, to install dibbler 0.4.1, issue following command:
\begin{verbatim}
rpm -i dibbler-0.4.1-1.i386.rpm 
\end{verbatim}

To install Dibbler on Debian or other system with dpkg management
system, run $dpkg -i archive.deb$ command. For example, to install
server, issue following command:

\begin{verbatim}
dpkg -i dibbler-server_0.4.1-1_i386.rpm 
\end{verbatim}

To install Dibbler in Gentoo systems, just type:

\begin{verbatim}
emerge dibbler
\end{verbatim}

If you would like to install Dibbler from sources, download tar.gz
source archive, extract it, type make followed by target (e.g. server,
client or relay\footnote{To get full target list, type: $make
  help$}). After successful compilation type make install. For
example, to build server and relay, type:

\begin{verbatim}
tar zxvf dibbler-0.1.0-src.tar.gz
make server relay
make install
\end{verbatim}

Depending what functionality do you want to use (server,client or relay),
you should edit config file (\verb+client.conf+ for client, \verb+server.conf+
for server and \verb+relay.conf+ for relay). All config files should
be placed in the \verb+/etc/dibbler+ directory. After editing, issue one of
the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
dibbler-server start
dibbler-client start
dibbler-relay start
\end{verbatim}

\verb+start+ parameter needs a little comment. It
instructs Dibbler to run in daemon mode -- detach from console and run
in the background. During config files fine-tuning, it is ofter better
to watch Dibbler's bahavior instantly. In this case, use \verb+run+
instead of \verb+start+ parameter. Dibbler will present its messages on
your console. To finish it, press ctrl-c.

To stop server, client or relay running in daemon mode, type:
\begin{verbatim}
dibbler-server stop
dibbler-client stop
dibbler-relay stop
\end{verbatim}

To see, if client, server or relay are running, type:

\begin{verbatim}
dibbler-server status
dibbler-client status
dibbler-relay status
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Windows installation}
Starting at 0.2.1, Dibbler supports Windows XP and 2003. In version
0.4.1 exprimental support for Windows NT4 and 2000 is provided. The easiest
way is to download clickable Windows installer. Download it from
\url{http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/}). After downloading, click on it and
follow on screen instructions. Dibbler will be installed and all
required links will be placed in the Start menu. Note that there are
two Windows versions: one for XP/2003 and one for NT4/2000. Make sure
to use proper port. If you haven't set up IPv6 support, see following
sections for details.

\subsection{Setting up IPv6 in Linux}
IPv6 can be enabled in Linux systems in two ways: compiled directly
into kernel or as a module. To verify if you have IPv6 support, issue
following command: \verb+ping6 ::1+. If you get replies, you have IPv6
already installed. If this fails, try to load IPv6 module:
\verb+modprobe ipv6+ (issued as root) and try ping6 once more. If that
fails, you have to recompile kernel to support IPv6. There are 
numerous descriptions how to recompile kernel available in the net, just
type "kernel compilation howto" in \href{Google}{http://www.google.com}.

\subsection{Setting up IPv6 in WindowsXP and 2003}
If you have already working IPv6 support, you can safely skip this section.
The easiest way to enable IPv6 support is to right click on the
\verb+My network place+ on the desktop, select \verb+Properties+, then locate
your network interface, right click it and select \verb+Properties+. Then
click \verb+Install...+, choose protocol and then IPv6 (its naming is
somewhat diffrent depending on what Service Pack you have installed).
In XP, there's much quicker way to install IPv6. Simply run command
\verb+ipv6 install+.

\subsection{Setting up IPv6 in Windows 2000}
If you have already working IPv6 support, you can safely skip this
section. The following description was provided by Sob 
\href{mailto:sob(at)hisoftware.cz}{sob(at)hisoftware.cz}. Thanks. This
description assumes that ServicePack 4 is already installed.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the file tpipv6-001205.exe from:
    \href{http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sdks/platform/tpipv6.asp}
    and save it to a local folder (for example, \verb+C:\IPv6TP+).
  \item From the local folder (\verb+C:\IPv6TP+), run \verb+Tpipv6-001205.exe+ and extract the
    files to the same location.
  \item From the local folder (\verb+C:\IPv6TP+), run \verb+Setup.exe -x+ and extract the files to
    a subfolder of the current folder (for example, \verb+C:\IPv6TP\files+).
  \item From the folder containing the extracted files (\verb+C:\IPv6TP\files+), open the
    file \verb+Hotfix.inf+ in a text editor.
  \item In the [Version] section of the Hotfix.inf file, change the line
    NTServicePackVersion=256 to NTServicePackVersion=1024, and then
    save changes. \footnote{This defines Service Pack requirement.
      NTServicePackVersion is a ServicePack version multiplied by 256. If there
    would be SP5 available, this value should have been changed to the 2048.}
  \item From the folder containing the extracted files (\verb+C:\IPv6TP\files+), run
    \verb+Hotfix.exe+.
  \item Restart the computer when prompted.
  \item After the computer is restarted, from the Windows 2000 desktop, click Start,
    point to Settings, and then click Network and Dial-up Connections. As an
    alternative, you can right-click My Network Places, and then click Properties.
  \item Right-click the Ethernet-based connection to which you want to add the IPv6
    protocol, and then click Properties. Typically, this connection is named
    Local Area Connection.
  \item Click Install.
  \item In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, click Protocol, and then
    click Add.
  \item In the Select Network Protocol dialog box, click Microsoft IPv6 Protocol and
    then click OK.
  \item Click Close to close the Local Area Connection Properties
    dialog box.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setting up IPv6 in Windows NT4}
If you have already working IPv6 support, you can safely skip this section.
The following description was provided by The following description was provided by Sob
\href{mailto:sob(at)hisoftware.cz}{sob(at)hisoftware.cz}. Thanks.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the file msripv6-bin-1-4.exe from:
    \href{http://research.microsoft.com/msripv6/msripv6.htm}
    and save it to a local folder (for example, \verb+C:\IPv6Kit+).
  \item From the local folder (\verb+C:\IPv6Kit+), run \verb+msripv6-bin-1-4.exe+ and extract the
    files to the same location.
  \item Start the Control Panel's "Network" applet (an alternative way to do this is
    to right-click on "Network Neighborhood" and select "Properties") and select
    the "Protocols" tab.
  \item Click the "Add..." button and then "Have Disk...". When it asks you for
    a disk, give it the full pathname to where you downloaded the binary
    distribution kit (\verb+C:\IPv6Kit+).
  \item IPv6 should be installed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Compilation}
Dibbler is distributed in 2 versions: binary and source. For
most users, binary version is better choice.  Compilation is
performed by more experienced users, preferably with programming
knowledge. It does not offer any advances over binary version, only
allows to understand internal Dibbler workings. You probably want just
install and use Dibbler. If that is your case, read section
named \emph{Installation}.

\subsection{Linux compilation}

Compilation in most cases is not necessary and should be performed
only by experienced users. Perferred method is to use binaries
provided on Dibbler's website. Issue following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
tar zxvf dibbler-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd dibbler
make server client relay doc
\end{verbatim}
That's it. You can also install it in the system by issuing command:

\begin{verbatim}
make install
\end{verbatim}

If there are problems with missing/different compiler
version, take a look at the beginning of the Makefile.inc
file. Dibbler was compiled using gcc 2.95, 3.0, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4
versions. Lexer files were generated using flex 2.5.31. Parser file
were created using bison++ 1.21.9\footnote{flex and bison++ tools are
  not required to compile Dibbler. Generated files are placed in CVS
  and in tar.gz archives}. Everything was developed under Debian
GNU/Linux system.

If there are problems with \verb+SrvLexer.cpp+ and
\verb+ClntLexer.cpp+ files, please use FlexLexer.h in Port-linux/
directory. Most simple way to do this is to copy this file to
\verb+/usr/include+ directory. Additional information about
compilation can be found in \emph{Dibbler Developer's Guide}.

\subsection{Windows XP/2003 compilation}
Download dibbler-0.3.0-src.tar.gz and extract it. In Port-winxp there
will be project files (for server, client and relay) for MS
Visual Studio. Open one of them and click Build command. That should
do the trick. Additional information about compilation can be found in
\emph{Dibbler Developer's Guide}.

\subsection{Windows NT/2000 compilation}
Windows NT4/2000 port is considered experimental, but there are reports
that it works just fine. To compile it, you should download dev-cpp
(\url{http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html}), a free IDE for
Windows utilising minGW port of the gcc for Windows. Run dev-cpp,
click ,,open project...'', and open of the \verb+*.dev+ files located
in the Port-winnt2k directory, then click compile. You also should
take a look at \verb+Port-winnt2k/INFO+ file for details.
