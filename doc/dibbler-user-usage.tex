\section{Installation and usage}
Client, server and relay are installed in the same way. Installation
method is different in WindowsXP and Linux systems, so they're described
separately. To simplify installation, it assumes that binary versions
are used\footnote{Compilation is not required, binary version can be
  used safely. Compilation should be performed by
  advanced users only, see \emph{Compilation} section for details.}.

\subsection{Linux installation}
Starting with 0.4.0, there will are 3 different packages: client,
server and relay. For some architectures there will be also
documentation package provided. During writing this documentation,
Dibbler is already present in the PLD Linux Distribution 2.0 in the
test section. There are efforts under way to include 
Dibbler in Debian GNU/Linux distribution as well as in Gentoo
GNU/Linux distribution.

Obtain (e.g. download from \url{http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/}) an
archive, which suits your needs. Currently there are provided RPM packages
(which can be used in RedHat, Fedora Core, Mandrake or PLD
distribution), DEB packages (suitable for Debian or Knoppix) and
ebuild (for Gentoo users). To install rpm package, run $rpm -i
archive.rpm$ command. For example, to install dibbler 0.4.0, issue following command:
\begin{verbatim}
rpm -i dibbler-0.4.0-1.i386.rpm 
\end{verbatim}

To install Dibbler on Debian or other system with dpkg management
system, run $dpkg -i archive.deb$ command. For example, to install
server, issue following command:

\begin{verbatim}
dpkg -i dibbler-server_0.4.0-1_i386.rpm 
\end{verbatim}

To install Dibbler in Gentoo systems, download ebuild script and issue
command:

\begin{verbatim}
emerge dibbler-0.3.1.ebuild
\end{verbatim}

If you would like to install Dibbler from sources, download tar.gz
source archive, extract it, type make followed by target (e.g. server,
client or relay\footnote{To get full target list, type: $make
  help$}). After successful compilation type make install. For
example, to build server and relay, type:

\begin{verbatim}
tar zxvf dibbler-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
make server relay
make install
\end{verbatim}

Depending what functionality do you want to use (server,client or relay),
you should edit config file (\verb+client.conf+ for client, \verb+server.conf+
for server and \verb+relay.conf+ for relay). All config files should
be placed in the \verb+/etc/dibbler+ directory. After editing, issue one of
the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
dibbler-server start
dibbler-client start
dibbler-relay start
\end{verbatim}

\verb+start+ parameter needs a little comment. It
instructs Dibbler to run in daemon mode -- detach from console and run
in the background. During config files fine-tuning, it is ofter better
to watch Dibbler's bahavior instantly. In this case, use \verb+run+
instead of \verb+start+ parameter. Dibbler will present its messages on
your console. To finish it, press ctrl-c.

To stop server, client or relay running in daemon mode, type:
\begin{verbatim}
dibbler-server stop
dibbler-client stop
dibbler-relay stop
\end{verbatim}

To see, if client, server or relay are running\footnote{Running status
  in Linux is based on /var/lib/dibbler/*.pid files. In rare
  occasions, when one of the server,client or relay crashes, this
  status will show its status as running.}, type:

\begin{verbatim}
dibbler-server status
dibbler-client status
dibbler-relay status
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Windows installation}
Starting at 0.2.1, Dibbler supports Windows XP and 2003. In version
0.4.1 exprimental support for Windows 2000 is provided. The easiest
way is to download clickable windows installer. Download it from
\url{http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/}). After downloading, click on it and
follow on screen instructions. Dibbler will be installed and all
required links will be placed in the Start menu.

\section{Compilation}
Dibbler is distributed in 2 versions: binary and source. For
most users, binary version is better choice.  Compilation is
performed by more experienced users, preferably with programming
knowledge. It does not offer any advances over binary version, only
allows to understand internal Dibbler workings. You probably want just
install and use Dibbler. If that is your case, read section
named \emph{Installation}.

\subsection{Linux compilation}

Compilation in most cases is not necessary and should be performed
only by experienced users. Perferred method is to use binaries
provided on Dibbler's website. Issue following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
tar zxvf dibbler-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd dibbler
make server client relay doc
\end{verbatim}
That's it. You can also install it in the system by issuing command:

\begin{verbatim}
make install
\end{verbatim}

If there are problems with missing/different compiler
version, take a look at the beginning of the Makefile.inc
file. Dibbler was compiled using gcc 2.95, 3.0, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4
versions. Lexer files were generated using flex 2.5.31. Parser file
were created using bison++ 1.21.9\footnote{flex and bison++ tools are
  not required to compile Dibbler. Generated files are placed in CVS
  and in tar.gz archives}. Everything was developed under Debian
GNU/Linux system.

If there are problems with \verb+SrvLexer.cpp+ and
\verb+ClntLexer.cpp+ files, please use FlexLexer.h in Port-linux/
directory. Most simple way to do this is to copy this file to
\verb+/usr/include+ directory. Additional information about
compilation can be found in \emph{Dibbler Developer's Guide}.

\subsection{Windows XP/2003 compilation}
Download dibbler-0.3.0-src.tar.gz and extract it. In Port-winxp there
will be project files (for server, client and relay) for MS
Visual C++ 2003. Open one of them and click Build command. That should
do the trick. Additional information about compilation can be found in
\emph{Dibbler Developer's Guide}.

\subsection{Windows 2000 compilation}
Windows 2000 port is considered experimental, but there are reports
that it works just fine. See Port-win2k/INFO file for details.
